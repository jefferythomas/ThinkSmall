##Big Improvements Can Come in Tiny Classes

In the iOS development community, every one seems to have a giant framework which you should integrate into your project. Of course, that giant framework dictates how you must write your code, interact with network services, and build your workspace. The problem is usually all you need is a tiny bit of functionality to fix a pain-point in your code.

In this talk, I will demonstrate tiny single file classes and categories which allow a developer to solve real world problems without having to refactor their code to fit into a giant framework.

Featured in this talk are context info, easy observation, waiter, map/reduce/filter for NSArray, and more. Context info is a way to add a little extra data to any object. Easy observation takes the pain and redundancy out of adding and removing observers and notifications. Waiter can turn unit tests into system tests. Map/reduce/filter are basic array operations which are missing or broken in NSArray. As time allows, I will also demonstrate event bus: adding type safety to NSNotification or custom segues for more complex transitions.
